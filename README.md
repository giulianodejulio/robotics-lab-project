This is the repository for the Technical Project of Robotics Lab exam by Giuliano de Julio.

To run the packages, type in a terminal `roslaunch rl_project_dejulio scenario_multiple_robots.launch`, which will spawn the Gazebo scene and run the node commanding the Kuka manipulator.

In another terminal, type `rosrun rl_project_dejulio movebase_client` to select the desired tool.
