# robotics-lab-project
This is the repository for my Technical Project for Robotics Lab exam.

To run the packages, type in a terminal `roslaunch rl_project_dejulio scenario_multiple_robots.launch`, which will spawn the Gazebo scene and run the node commanding the Kuka manipulator.

In another terminal, type `rosrun rl_project_dejulio movebase_client` to select the desired tool.
